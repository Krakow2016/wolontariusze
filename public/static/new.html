            <p>The volunteer job is often considered as a <i>cheap labor</i> and we want to change it. We are building the Mountain of Good for a strong and independent community of volunteers. Thanks to our portal, we want to inspire the other people to help each other. ohn Paul II during the pilgrimage in Lyon (France) said:
                <i>Do not concentrate on your weaknesses and doubts .... Get up, straighten up and go</i>
